        "analyse_ia": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the match between ADT and Alianza Universidad to make the safest prediction possible for a combined bet. Let me go through all the provided data step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the current standings: ADT is 8th and Alianza Universidad is 19th. That suggests ADT is in a better position overall, but I need to see how they've been performing recently.\n\nThe average goals scored are 0.50 for ADT and 0.83 for Alianza Universidad. So, Alianza scores a bit more on average, but ADT is playing at home. ADT's average conceded is 1.17, while Alianza's is 2.00. That means ADT has a slightly better defense.\n\nLooking at the recent form, ADT has ['W', 'W', 'D', 'D', 'L', 'L'], which means they've had two wins and two draws recently but ended with two losses. Alianza Universidad has ['L', 'L', 'L', 'W', 'L', 'L'], which is mostly losses with only one win. So, ADT's recent form is better, even though they have a couple of losses.\n\nADT's home form is W-W-D-L, which isn't too bad, while Alianza's away form is L-L-L. They haven't been performing well on the road. This makes me think ADT has a home advantage.\n\nThere's a bonus for weak defenses, which I'm not entirely sure how to apply here, but given that Alianza concedes more, maybe ADT can capitalize on that. The offensive factor is x1.20, which might mean ADT has a slight edge in scoring.\n\nLooking at the Poisson probabilities, ADT has a 61.98% chance to win, which is quite high. The probability of both teams scoring is only 6.24%, which is very low. That suggests it's unlikely that Alianza will score, especially considering their poor away form.\n\nThe over 1.5 is 32.51%, so not very likely, and under 3.5 is 96.89%, meaning the match will probably have fewer goals. But since the probability of both teams scoring is so low, maybe it's safer to bet on ADT winning without Alianza scoring.\n\nConsidering all this, the safest bet seems to be a \"Victoire équipe 1\" because ADT has a higher chance of winning, better recent form, and a home advantage, plus Alianza's poor away record and low probability of scoring.\n</think>\n\n**Prédiction finale : Victoire équipe 1**  \n**Raisonnement :**  \nADT a une meilleure forme récente, un avantage à domicile, et une défense plus solide. Alianza Universidad a une forme décevante à l'extérieur et une faible probabilité de marquer. Ces facteurs renforcent la probabilité d'une victoire d'ADT.",
