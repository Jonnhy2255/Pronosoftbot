MISSION :
1. Analyse comparative des deux équipes (forces/faiblesses)
2. Impact du facteur domicile/extérieur
3. Analyse des formes récentes et tendances à partir des matchs détaillés AVEC LEURS STATISTIQUES
4. Analyse du contexte du championnat grâce au classement complet
5. Prise en compte des confrontations directes récentes avec leurs statistiques détaillées
6. Évaluation des cotes (si disponibles)
7. ✨ NOUVEAU : Analyse approfondie des statistiques détaillées des matchs passés (possession, tirs, corners, etc.)
8. Prédiction finale claire : UNE SEULE recommandation parmi :
   - "Victoire domicile" ({home})
   - "Victoire extérieur" ({away})
   - "Plus de 2.5 buts"
   - "Moins de 2.5 buts"
   - "BTTS oui" (Both Teams To Score)
   - "BTTS non"
   - "Double chance 1X" (domicile ou nul)
   - "Double chance X2" (nul ou extérieur)

9. ✨ NOUVEAUTÉS OBLIGATOIRES :
   - Prédiction CORNERS : "Total +1.5 corners" ou "Total -1.5 corners" (soyez réaliste : si vous prévoyez 8+ corners → +1.5, si vous prévoyez 6- corners → -1.5)
   - Prédiction TIRS CADRÉS : "Total +1.5 tirs cadrés" ou "Total -1.5 tirs cadrés" (soyez réaliste : si vous prévoyez 8+ tirs cadrés → +1.5, si vous prévoyez 6- tirs cadrés → -1.5)
   - POURCENTAGE DE CONFIANCE (0-100%) pour ta prédiction principale
   - LES 2 SCORES LES PLUS PROBABLES (ex: "1-0 ou 2-1")

⚠️ IMPORTANT : Ne JAMAIS prédire "Match nul" - utilise "Double chance 1X" ou "Double chance X2" à la place.

Justifie ta prédiction avec toutes les données statistiques fournies, en tenant compte particulièrement des matchs récents détaillés avec leurs statistiques complètes, du contexte du classement et des confrontations directes avec leurs stats détaillées.

FORMAT DE RÉPONSE OBLIGATOIRE :
- PRÉDICTION PRINCIPALE : [ta prédiction]
- CONFIANCE : [X]%
- CORNERS : [Total +1.5 corners OU Total -1.5 corners]
- TIRS CADRÉS : [Total +1.5 tirs cadrés OU Total -1.5 tirs cadrés]
- SCORES PROBABLES : [Score1] ou [Score2]
- JUSTIFICATION : [ton analyse détaillée]
